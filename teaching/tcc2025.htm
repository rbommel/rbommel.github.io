						This course took place in Bristol, and online on Teams (as part of <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/tcc">TCC</a>) in May and June 2025.<br /><br />				
						Questions, comments, and remarks are encouraged.

						<h1><a name="Abstract" id="abstract"></a>Abstract</h1>
The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is a millennium problem originally stated for elliptic curves over the rationals and later generalised to abelian varieties over number fields. In this course, we will learn about the different geometric and arithmetic invariants that occur in the conjecture and their significance in the broader context of arithmetic geometry.

				You can find some notes <a href="tcc2025.pdf">here</a> (<a href="tcc2025.tex">TeX</a>). Any errors in it are mine. Please feel encouraged to report such errors to me. Other suggestions are also welcome.
				
				<h1><a name="prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h1>
				Certainly you don't need to know all of these topics to join the course, but if you do, it might help you connect it to other things you know about.
				There might not be enough time in the course to discuss these topics in the full detail they deserve, so you might find it beneficial to read a bit about these topics yourself between the lectures.
				<ul><li>Elliptic curves / abelian varieties (over the complex numbers, over number, local and finite fields)</li>
				<li>Algebraic geometry (curves, schemes)</li>
				<li>Number fields, local / p-adic fields (extensions, Galois theory, class groups)</li>
				<li>Cohomology (sheaf cohomology, group cohomology, Galois cohomology)</li></ul>
